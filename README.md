# IMM Sensors Network

The project consists in the implementation of a network of sensors which measure and extimate the position, velocity and acceleration of an agent in a room. The agent can move in multiple different ways and the network has to adapt his estimation to match the distributed measurements and the model of movement. The algorithm used to do so is the Interacting Multiple Models algorithm.
