||IMM Sensors Network

The project consists in the implementation of a network of sensors which extimate the position, velocity and acceleration of an agent in a room. The agent can move in different ways and the network has to adapt his extimation to match the situation, it should do so using the Interacting Multiple Models algorithm.
